# CS1400
Introductory programming class taught by my local high school in partnership with Weber State University. This is a continuation of [Programming I](https://github.com/snoutibur-academic/Programming1). 
Also known as Computer Programming II at that high school.

I completed this course in the spring of 2023.

At the time, I was using VSCode + Maven as my editor and compiler.
